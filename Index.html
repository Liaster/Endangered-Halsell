    <h2>About the Sunda Tiger</h2>
    <p>The Sunda Tiger is known as the only living tiger  in Indonesia. They are the smallest in their subspecies but have dark dense fur with narrow stripes, which allow them to camouflage light reflection mimicking on the forest floor. They are also have a more bearded and maned look than other species. There are around 400-500 of these tigers left on Sumatra. These tigers can be found in a range of places from forest to sub-mountains. They often prey on deer and pigs but will sometimes eat others things like fish and birds. Males can be about 8ft and up to 120kg while females can be 7ft and weigh 91kg.</p>

    <h2>The Sunda Tiger's Endangerment</h2>
    <p>The sunda tiger is in a dangerous spot due to things such as poaching, where hunters will trap or kill the tigers for their skin, bones, and other parts due to the high prices on the market and their use in medicine. The tigers also constantly lose habitat due to lodging, agricultural encroachment, and plantation expansion, which constantly removes the land they need to live on. Tigers also lose many of their prey to these reasons, losing many of the things they kill to provide nutrition to themselves and possibly other tigers.</p>

    <h2>The Importance of Sunda Tigers</h2>
    <p>The island of Sumatra is the only place where tigers, rhinos, orangutans, and elephants live together in the wild. The presence of the Sunda tiger is an important indicator of a forest's health and biodiversity. Protecting tigers and their habitat means many other species benefitâ€”including people.</p>
